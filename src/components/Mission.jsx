          In the recent Covid-19 pandemic, dependency  on internet and technology
          has increased <br/>  substantially so has  the number  of cyber crimes.
          <br />
          <br />
          It is really alarming that most of the people   donâ€™t know how to protect
          themselves <br/>  from    these  cyber crimes, and many fall into these   scams and
          lose their hard earned money etc..
          <br />
          <br />
          It is our mission to increase cyber awareness  around
          the globe, <br/> preventing many people  from falling into these scams.
