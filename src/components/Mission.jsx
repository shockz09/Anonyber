      <p className="text-xl">
        In the recent Covid-19 pandemic, dependency  <br /> on internet and technology 
        has increased  <br /> substantially so has the number of cyber crimes. 
        <br />
        <br />
        It is really alarming that most of the people  <br /> donâ€™t know how to protect
        themselves from  <br />  these   cyber crimes, and many fall into these  <br /> scams and 
        lose their hard earned money etc.. 
        <br />
        <br />
        It is our mission to increase cyber awareness  <br /> around
        the globe, preventing many people from falling  <br /> into these scams.
